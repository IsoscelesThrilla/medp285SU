    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>
      This webpage will act as a fan site for my favorite band, Lightning Bolt.
      My goal for this project is to thoroughly showcase why Lightning Bolt is
      such a unique band. Moreover, I’d like this webpage to be a place where
      someone unfamiliar with the band can get a good idea of what they’re about
      and their general sound, and hopefully create a new fan in the process.

    <h2>Full Description</h2>
    <p>
      For my final project, I plan to create a space on the internet dedicated
      to my favorite band, Lightning Bolt. Ultimately I want to express to the
      viewer how special of a band Lightning Bolt is; not only in the space of
      noise rock and other extreme music genres, but music in general. I plan to
      include a biography that explains how the two members of the band, Brian
      Chippendale and Brian Gibson, met, their own lives, and other things such
      as their musical process. I will also include at least one image of the
      two together in or near the biography. In order to showcase the band’s
      body of work I will include small images of each of their albums with
      their respective names and perhaps other info such as release dates. I
      will most likely organize this on one side of the webpage, perhaps from
      top to bottom. I also want the viewer to be able to hover over each of the
      albums and click them to be brought to a full stream of the album on
      Youtube, or to the bands Bandcamp page. An aspect that I want to put the
      most importance on is videos of the band performing, since what truly
      makes Lightning Bolt special is their live performances. I will most
      likely include 2 or 3 of my favorite performances. The drummer of the
      band, Brian Chippendale, is also a prolific artist, so I plan on including
      some of his art in the webpage. The background of the webpage will be made
      up of either one or several of his art pieces. The general color scheme of
      the webpage will then most likely complement Chippendale’s art pieces and
      the art on the band’s albums, so the webpage will be composed of brighter
      colors. In terms of an intended audience for this webpage, it would
      honestly be anybody who takes the time to explore it. It can act as a
      gateway to a different type of music that someone may not have heard
      before, or it can also act as a haven for other fans of Lightning Bolt and
      bands similar to them.
